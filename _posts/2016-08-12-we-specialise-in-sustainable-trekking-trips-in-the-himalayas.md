  foundation. We offer guided high level mountain walks, via ferrata, refuge to
  refuge and Himalayan guided routes, including Everest, maximising each day for
  all ages, schools, disadvantaged children, child carers and our more able
  clients. You don't need to be an athlete, just a love of mountains and a
  certain degree of hill walking fitness.
